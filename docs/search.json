    "text": "With global change, ecological communities increasingly face new and changing environments. Species exhibit marked variation in the magnitude and direction of their response to environmental change through plasticity and genetic change. Understanding these responses, whether beneficial or maladaptive, is crucial for predicting their impact on community and ecosystem dynamics. To understand the patterns and consequences of species-specific responses to environmental change, I evaluate multiple aspects of species response, including growth, demography, morphological traits, and phenology changes. And I use a diverse range of research methods, including theory development, observational studies, field and greenhouse experiments, meta-analyses, and syntheses of global databases in a variety of systems including urban, grassland, desert, and forest environments.\nOverall, I am broadly interested in 1) how to assess the predictability of and variability in species responses to global change and 2) how species’ varied responses to global change affect species interactions and community dynamics.\n\n\n\nSpecies can have variable responses to changes in their environment through global change (bottom-left). These responses can scale up to impact community processes, including species interactions and community composition (top-left), which can alter ecosystem functions (right).\n\n\n\n\nAnthropogenic climate change has large-scale impacts on plant communities by altering species phenology, distributions, and abundance. The dominant paradigm is to use spatial variation in climatic conditions to forecast ecological responses to future climate change. Yet, this approach can lead to incorrect estimates of the magnitude and direction of ecological response to climate due to local adaptations and non-climatic environmental factors within sites. When not substituting space for time, another method for inferring shifts in phenological events, particularly, is to utilize herbarium specimens. Although this method has advanced the field by allowing us to examine phenological shifts over multiple decades and for many species, it focuses on a singular phenological event, which limits our ability to understand the consequences of phenological shifts for community processes. Thus, a significant restriction in predicting ecological response to future climate change is a lack of long-term data. I work with long-term data sets on plant community composition and species phenology to ask questions such as:\n\nAre there general trends across species in how they respond to changes in climate?\nAre there trade-offs in species’ demographic responses to climate?\nHow do differential sensitivities of species to climate impact species interactions and community dynamics?\n\nBy coupling long-term data with an undergraduate research initiative to measure desert plant traits at the University of Arizona, we are asking questions such as:\n\nWhat are the key functional strategies used by desert plants?\nDo differential functional strategies impact desert plant species’ sensitivity to climate change?\n\n\n\n\nDesert Laboratory VIP students and Dr. Deborah Goldberg in the field\n\n\n\n\n\nIntense competition is often highlighted as a major force driving species loss; however, plant-plant interactions vary not only in strength but in direction (e.g., competition vs facilitation) and the degree of inequality (e.g., competitive size asymmetry) and transitivity. Further, the consequences of plant-plant interactions can be highly context-dependent, varying with microbial interactions and resource distributions, for example. I use field and laboratory experiments to answer questions such as:\n\nWhat aspects of plant-plant interactions are most associated with species loss and gain?\nHow does environmental variability, in time and space, alter the consequences of plant-plant interactions?\nUnder which conditions are the outcomes of plant-plant interactions predictable?\nHow will future global change alter plant-plant interactions?\n\n\n\n\nField assistant Kelsie Hardman taking photographs on experimental plant communities"

I have worked in a diverse range of environments, including urban areas, grasslands, deserts, and forests.\nIn my postdoctoral work with Dr. Mark Vellend at the Université de Sherbrooke, I am examining the climatic drivers of species’ phenological shifts and how variation in species sensitivities, both in magnitude and to particular climatic events, impact current and future species interactions, flowering synchrony, and overall community structure.\nBefore that, I was an Ike Russell Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Arizona, where I worked with Dr. Deborah Goldberg, Dr. Larry Venable, Dr. Brian Enquist, and the members of the Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill to examine patterns in species sensitivities to climate and its impacts on 100+ years of community change. I completed my PhD (2021) with Dr. JC Cahill at the University of Alberta, where I used lab and field experiments to test the role of size in plant-plant interactions and species diversity. I completed my BSc (2014) at Dalhousie University, where I worked on a project examining species growth and community dynamics on green roofs in Dr. Jeremy Lundholm’s lab at Saint Mary’s University.\nSee here for more about my research"
